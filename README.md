# HOLC_redlining

This repository contains materials accompanying an analysis of historical redlining data as it relates to geographical disparities in bird biodiversity sampling in the United States.

## About

Here you will find a notebook named 'HOLC_redlining.Rmd' which analyzes data about historical redlining and impacts on bird biodiversity sampling, as well as an analysis of overlaps with EJScreen categories.

## Visualization

We will first create a map of historical redlining boundaries, colored by HOLC grade to get a better context overall of redlining data. After exploring the data, we create a plot to visualize the percent of bird observations within each redlining category.

## Highlights

-   Data wrangling and exploration

-   Merging of tabular data

-   Creating and customizing a redlining map
